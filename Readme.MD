This script allows for adding higher time period averages to your chart.  For example you could add a Daily simple moving average to your 10min chart or a 30min exponential moving average to your 5min chart, etc.

Can be customized through the inputs and options screen (gear icon in ToS edit studies page)

Note: Time period must be greater than the time period you are currently in.
